# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
Heart Disease Prediction is an interactive, **deployment-ready** web app built using Python and Streamlit to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input their health data and receive a prediction powered by a trained machine learning model.

## Features
- User-friendly frontend built with Streamlit.
- Input form for key health indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
- Real-time heart disease prediction based on a trained ML model.
- Clean, intuitive UI accessible through a web browser.
- Ready for deployment on platforms like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or any web server.
- Developed and run locally within an Anaconda environment using VS Code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/harshit7271/Heart-Disease-Prediction-PROJECT.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
3. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a conda environment:
    conda create -n heartdiseaseenv python=3.8
    conda activate heartdiseaseenv
4. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Launch the app locally:
   streamlit run app.py
2. The app will open in your default web browser.
3. Enter your health details in the form, and view the prediction results instantly.

## Deployment

The project is **deployment-ready** and can be published to cloud platforms such as:

- Streamlit Cloud
- Heroku
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Any web server supporting Python apps

Ensure you include required environment variables, dependencies, and model files during deployment. Example commands or config files for deployment can be added for specific targets.

## Project Structure

- `app.py` — Streamlit app handling UI and prediction logic.
- `model.pkl` — Serialized ML model file used for prediction.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- Other supporting scripts and data files.
